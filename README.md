# IBMDataAnalyst

## IBM Data Analyst Capstone Project

I applied various Data Analytics skills and techniques that I have learned as part of the courses in the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate. Assuming that I'm in the role of an Associate Data Analyst who has recently joined the organization and be presented with a business challenge that requires data analysis to be performed on real-world datasets.

I undertook the tasks of collecting data from multiple sources, performing exploratory data analysis, data wrangling and preparation, statistical analysis and mining the data, creating charts and plots to visualize data, and building an interactive dashboard. The project will culminate with a presentation of my data analysis report, with an executive summary for the various stakeholders in the organization.
